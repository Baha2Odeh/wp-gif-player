* If you deactivate or uninstall WP GIF Player, instead of the media, the shortcode [WPGP gif_id=".."] will appear in your posts. To replace shortcodes with your media you will have to edit these posts manually (An automated solution is planed but we can't guaranteed that it will work on posts created with this version of WP GIf Player).

* Set no thumbnail at all (e.g. if you don't display thumbnails in your theme)
* Set the first frame of the first GIF in your post as the thumbnail (e.g. if you want a still image and not a whole GIF to display as the thumbnail)
